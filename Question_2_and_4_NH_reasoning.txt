Pizza Delivery Code - Design Reasoning and Implementation Decisions
================================================================

1. PROBLEM ANALYSIS
------------------
The problem requires calculating the minimum travel cost for delivering pizzas to 10 locations using a single vehicle with limited capacity. Key constraints:
- Vehicle capacity limitation requires multiple trips
- Manhattan distance metric for cost calculation
- All trips must start and end at depot (0,0)
- Greedy approach is sufficient (not optimal solution required)

2. ALGORITHM CHOICE: GREEDY APPROACH
-----------------------------------
Reason: The problem explicitly states that a greedy approach is sufficient and exact optimization is not required. This makes the solution:
- Simpler to implement and understand
- Faster execution time O(n²) vs exponential for optimal solutions
- Meets competition requirements without over-engineering

3. GREEDY STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION
--------------------------------
The greedy selection works by:
- Iterating through remaining locations in order
- Adding locations to current trip until capacity is reached
- No sophisticated ordering or optimization within trips

Reason: This approach ensures vehicle capacity is maximally utilized while keeping the algorithm simple and predictable.

4. DATA STRUCTURE DECISIONS
--------------------------

a) Using list.copy() for remaining_locations:
   - Prevents modification of original input data
   - Allows safe removal of processed locations
   - Maintains data integrity for potential reuse

b) trip_locations list:
   - Stores locations for current trip
   - Enables sequential travel cost calculation
   - Clear separation between trip planning and execution

5. DISTANCE CALCULATION APPROACH
-------------------------------
Manhattan distance function is separated because:
- Reusability across multiple distance calculations
- Clear mathematical implementation
- Easy to test and verify independently
- Follows single responsibility principle

6. TRIP COST CALCULATION LOGIC
-----------------------------
The cost calculation follows this sequence:
1. Depot → First location
2. Between consecutive locations in trip
3. Last location → Depot

Reason: This ensures every movement is accounted for and matches real-world delivery patterns where vehicles must return to base.

7. LOOP STRUCTURE CHOICES
------------------------

a) Outer while loop (remaining_locations):
   - Continues until all deliveries are complete
   - Natural termination condition
   - Handles variable number of trips automatically

b) Inner while loop with index manipulation:
   - Allows removal of items during iteration
   - Avoids index errors when list size changes
   - More efficient than creating new filtered lists

8. CAPACITY CONSTRAINT HANDLING
------------------------------
The capacity check (current_capacity + pizzas <= capacity) ensures:
- No trip exceeds vehicle limits
- Efficient vehicle utilization
- Compliance with problem constraints
- Simple boolean logic for decision making

9. ERROR PREVENTION MEASURES
---------------------------

a) Copying input list:
   - Prevents accidental modification of caller's data
   - Enables multiple function calls with same input

b) Depot coordinates as variables:
   - Easy to modify if depot location changes
   - Clear code readability
   - Consistent reference point

10. TESTING AND VALIDATION
-------------------------
The example in __main__ provides:
- 10 locations as required by problem
- Mixed pizza quantities to test capacity logic
- Realistic coordinate values
- Capacity that requires multiple trips

11. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS
-----------------------------
- Time complexity: O(n²) where n is number of locations
- Space complexity: O(n) for storing locations and trips
- Acceptable for competition constraints (only 10 locations)
- No premature optimization that would complicate code

12. CODE MAINTAINABILITY
-----------------------
- Clear variable names (current_capacity, trip_locations)
- Comprehensive docstrings explaining strategy
- Logical code organization with helper functions
- Comments explaining non-obvious logic steps

13. COMPETITION-SPECIFIC DECISIONS
---------------------------------
- Output only numeric result as required
- Documented greedy strategy for judges
- No unnecessary features (timing, customer satisfaction)
- Focus on distance minimization only
- Python implementation as specified

CONCLUSION
----------
This implementation prioritizes simplicity, correctness, and meeting competition requirements over optimal performance. The greedy approach provides a reasonable solution while remaining easy to understand and verify.
